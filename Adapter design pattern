Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to 
work together by converting the interface of one class into another interface that the client expects.

Adapter Pattern acts as a bridge between incompatible interfaces.


// ===== TARGET INTERFACE =====
interface Charger {
    void chargePhone();
}

// ===== ADAPTEE (Old / Existing Class) =====
class OldCharger {
    public void supplyPower() {
        System.out.println("Power supplied using old charger");
    }
}

// ===== ADAPTER =====
class ChargerAdapter implements Charger {

    private OldCharger oldCharger;

    public ChargerAdapter(OldCharger oldCharger) {
        this.oldCharger = oldCharger;
    }

    @Override
    public void chargePhone() {
        oldCharger.supplyPower();   // adapting method
    }
}

// ===== CLIENT =====
public class AdapterDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        OldCharger oldCharger = new OldCharger();

        Charger charger = new ChargerAdapter(oldCharger);
        charger.chargePhone();
    }
}
