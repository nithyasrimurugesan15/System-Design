Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define multiple algorithms, put each one in a separate class, and switch between them at runtime.

Strategy Pattern = Same action, different behavior, switchable at runtime

Strategy Pattern lets you change behavior at runtime without changing the class.

🧠 Simple Meaning (Real-Life)
Example: Navigation App 🗺️

Car route

Bike route

Walking route

👉 Same destination
👉 Different strategies
👉 Can switch anytime

🔹 When to Use Strategy Pattern?

Use it when:

You have multiple ways to do the same task

You want to avoid if–else chains

Behavior changes at runtime


CODE:

// ===== STRATEGY INTERFACE =====
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}

// ===== CONCRETE STRATEGIES =====
class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card");
    }
}

class UPIPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using UPI");
    }
}

// ===== CONTEXT =====
class PaymentContext {

    private PaymentStrategy strategy;

    void setStrategy(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    void payAmount(int amount) {
        strategy.pay(amount);
    }
}

// ===== CLIENT =====
public class StrategyPatternDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        PaymentContext payment = new PaymentContext();

        payment.setStrategy(new CreditCardPayment());
        payment.payAmount(500);

        payment.setStrategy(new UPIPayment());
        payment.payAmount(300);
    }
}
